// Question: Object or just as a function in a file?
//
// Answer:
// You can either put your methods in the top-level declaration or inside an object. It's all about whether you
// want to pollute namespaces or not. You can have a function named X in an object and you can still have a function
// name X in a different object file since you can refer to specific method with the help of their object name. But you
// won't be able to do this if you declare methods top-level, each method would need to have a unique signature
// name(not counting overloaded methods).
//
// Additionally, object can have supertypes, meaning you can inherit other classes or implement interfaces. Neither
// introduces more technical capability over another. If you define variables in an object or as top-level, both will
// be initialized lazily.
//
// In short, it depends if you want to pollute namespaces or not.
